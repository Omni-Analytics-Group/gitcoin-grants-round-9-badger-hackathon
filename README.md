# Description

We know the Badger community loves Bitcoin as much as we love analytics and it's that shared love that motivated our submission for Round 9 of the Gitcoin Grants Hackathon.  Over the course of the last couple of weeks we've developed an open source Bitcoin Liquidity Dashboard designed to track Bitcoin adoption on Ethereum.  To accomplish this, we used Uniswap's subgraphs to pull information on all the liquidity pools that had a wrapped Bitcoin in its pair. This turned out to be about 170 pairs. The data collected also included amount of liquidity in the pool at the time of query and a time stamp on when the contract was deployed.  We crunched a few numbers in R, made some plots and then arranged this information into a neat dashboard. We hope you find it useful.
